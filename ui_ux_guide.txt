UI/UX Guidelines for Checkout Page

1. Input Field Behavior
   - All input fields must show red error text below them when invalid.
   - Discount error message must be displayed in red using the "error" class.

2. Buttons
   - "Pay Now" button must be green (#00A000 or similar) with white text.
   - "Apply" button must be placed next to the discount field.
   - Add-to-cart buttons must instantly update the quantity fields.

3. Discount Code Field
   - Must allow typing any string.
   - Error message should appear only when an invalid code is applied.
   - Trimming spaces should happen automatically when checking the code.

4. Total Price
   - Updated total must always be visible.
   - Value is displayed in the element with id="total-price".
   - Should always show two decimal places.

5. Form Validation (Name, Email, Address)
   - Errors appear immediately when the Pay Now button is clicked with invalid fields.
   - Success message must appear below Pay Now when payment is valid.

6. Layout
   - Section titles should use <h3> for consistency.
   - Summary sections should group logically (Products → Cart → Discount → Details → Shipping → Payment).
